# THULAC Tutorial: An efficient Chinese lexical analysis toolkit

## Software Description

THULAC (THU Lexical Analyzer for Chinese) is a set of Chinese lexical analysis toolkit developed by the Natural Language Processing and Social Humanity Computing Laboratory of Tsinghua University, with Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging functions. It has strong reliability and accuracy as well as high speed. THULAC has the following characteristics:

1. **Strong Ability**. It is trained using the integrated world's largest artificial word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging Chinese corpus (containing about 58 million chinese characters), and the model has strong tagging capabilities.

2. **High Accuracy**. The accuracy rate is high. The F1 value of word segmentation of this toolkit on the standard data set Chinese Treebank (CTB5) can reach 97.3%, and the F1 value of part-of-speech tagging can reach 92.9%, which is equivalent to the best method on this data set.

3. **Fast Processing Speed**. The speed is faster. The speed of simultaneous word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging is 300KB/s, and it can process about 150,000 words per second. Only the word segmentation speed can reach 1.3MB/s.


## Compile and install

1. C++ version
- Run under current path
- make
- Will get thulac and train_c in the current directory
(Thulac needs the support of the model, and the downloaded model needs to be placed in the current directory)

2. Java version
- Run the executable jar package directly according to the word segmentation program command format
- To compile by yourself, you need to install Gradle, and then execute gradle build in the project root directory, and the generated files are under build/libs
(Thulac needs the support of the model, and the downloaded model needs to be placed in the current directory)

3. Python version (compatible with python2.x and python3.x)
- Source code download
Put the thulac file in the directory and reference it by `import thulac`
(Thulac needs the support of the model, and the downloaded model needs to be placed in the thulac directory.)

- pip download
`sudo pip install thulac`
Reference by `import thulac`
